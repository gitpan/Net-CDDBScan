Net::CDDBScan is a simple HTTP interface to the CDDB database.
This module allows you to do string searches without the need
for the CD or the CD ID that is normally needed. If you use
this module and would like to see it continue, please let me
know as I am currently looking for beta testers. Comments,
suggestions, requests, etc. are very welcome.
